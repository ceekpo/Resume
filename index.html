    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="./photo-of-me.jpg" alt="Photo of me and my girlfriend in Singapore" height="200"> <p>(I rarely take photos, so please bare with my photo of me with my girlfriend)</p>
    <p>I'm Zach, a 21 year old that is aspiring to become a web developer. I've only made a few projects with html, <br>
    but I feel like I am starting to get a really good grasp of how it all works out. 
    </p>

    <p>I currently work in the Logistics field. I am a driven individual that always does the work assigned to me <br>
     and if I am aware of something that needs to be done, I will make sure to do it even if I am not asked to do so.<br>
     My best quality is that I am confident in my ability to learn new skills quickly. During my first quarter of working<br>
     at my current job, I was given a raise for exceeding expectations and quickly becoming a vital team member.<br>
     I am currently the back-up for the head of the receiving department at my job. Despite not having a previous job remotely,<br>
     I am very confident I will be able to excel in a remote environment as I have grown up using computers and am very familiar<br>
     with the usual business software such as Microsoft Office. I love to learn new skills.</p>
